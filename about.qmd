Hello, my name is Yimin and I am currently a postgraduate student in Singapore Management University (SMU), studying Masters of IT in Business (AI track).

This site is created to record my learning journey on ISSS624 Geospatial Analytics Applications, taught by Professor. Kam Tin Seong.

You may also wish to checkout my [Github Repository](https://github.com/yiminzheng29) on other projects that I have done in the past/doing currently.
